# GDPR Compliance Guide for Insurance Consultants

## General Data Protection Regulation - Practical Implementation

---

## Overview

**GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)** is the EU's comprehensive data privacy law, effective May 25, 2018. It applies to any organization processing personal data of EU residents, regardless of where the organization is located.

**Penalties for Non-Compliance:**
- Up to **€20 million** OR
- **4% of global annual turnover** (whichever is higher)

**Why Insurance Must Comply:**
- Processes extensive personal data (health, financial, behavioral)
- High-value customer relationships
- Regulatory oversight
- Reputational risk

## GDPR Principles

### 1. Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency
- Legal basis required for processing
- Clear communication to data subjects
- No hidden processing

### 2. Purpose Limitation
- Collect data for specified, explicit purposes
- Don't use for incompatible purposes later
- Document purposes clearly

### 3. Data Minimization
- Collect only what's necessary
- No "nice to have" data
- Regular review and deletion

### 4. Accuracy
- Keep data accurate and up-to-date
- Enable corrections
- Validate data quality

### 5. Storage Limitation
- Retain only as long as necessary
- Define retention periods
- Automated deletion processes

### 6. Integrity and Confidentiality (Security)
- Protect against unauthorized access
- Prevent data breaches
- Encryption and access controls

### 7. Accountability
- Demonstrate compliance
- Document everything
- Regular audits and reviews

### Legal Bases for Processing

**Must Have at Least One:**

1. **Consent:** Data subject gave clear consent
   - Example: Marketing emails
   - Must be freely given, specific, informed
   - Easy to withdraw

2. **Contract:** Necessary for contract performance
   - Example: Processing claim to pay out
   - Fulfilling policy obligations

3. **Legal Obligation:** Required by law
   - Example: Anti-money laundering checks

4. **Vital Interests:** Protecting life
   - Example: Emergency medical data access
   - Rare use case

5. **Public Task:** Performing public interest task
   - Example: Public sector insurance

## Insurance-Specific GDPR Considerations

### Health Insurance

**Challenge:** Extensive special category data (health)
**Solutions:**
- Explicit consent for non-claims processing
- "Necessary for insurance" legal basis for claims
- Enhanced security (separate systems, encryption)
- Limited access (need-to-know basis)
- Regular DPIAs

### Telematics / Usage-Based Insurance

**Challenge:** Continuous location and behavior monitoring
**Solutions:**
- Clear consent with easy withdrawal
- Purpose limitation (pricing only, not other uses)
- Data minimization (aggregate where possible)
- Transparency (show customers their data)
- DPIA required

### Automated Underwriting

**Challenge:** Automated decision-making
**Solutions:**
- Human review option
- Explainability of decisions
- Right to contest
- Document logic and criteria
- Regular bias audits

### Legacy Systems

**Challenge:** Difficulty implementing technical controls
**Solutions:**
- Compensating controls (procedural)
- Migration roadmap
- Risk assessment and documentation
- Prioritize high-risk data
- Interim encryption solutions

## Common GDPR Mistakes

**1. Assuming "Legitimate Interests" Applies to Everything**
- Must document balancing test
- Data subject interests may override
- Consent may be safer for marketing

**2. Keeping Data "Just in Case"**
- Define retention periods
- Delete when no longer needed
- Don't keep "might be useful someday"

**3. No Process for Data Subject Requests**
- 1-month deadline is firm
- Need technical capability to extract/delete
- Test the process before needed

**4. Vendor Contracts Without DPAs**
- Every processor needs DPA
- Standard Contractual Clauses for international
- Don't assume vendor is compliant

**5. Privacy Policy as Legal Document Only**
- Must be clear and understandable
- Not just legal boilerplate
- Test with real users

**6. No Regular Reviews**
- Compliance is continuous, not one-time
- Regular audits essential
- Update as processing changes

---

**GDPR compliance is an ongoing journey, not a destination. Build robust processes, document everything, and prioritize data subject rights.**
