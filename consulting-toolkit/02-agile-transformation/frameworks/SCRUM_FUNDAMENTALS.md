# Scrum Fundamentals for Consulting

## The Most Popular Agile Framework - Quick Implementation Guide

---

## Overview

**Scrum** is the most widely used agile framework, adopted by 76% of agile organizations. It's lightweight, simple to understand, and powerful for delivering complex products iteratively.

**When to Use Scrum:**
- Building products/software with evolving requirements
- Team size of 5-11 people
- Can work in 2-4 week iterations
- Need for rapid feedback and adaptation
- Stakeholders available for collaboration

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Faster time to market (30-50% improvement)
- Higher quality through iterative development
- Better stakeholder engagement
- Increased team autonomy and morale
- Rapid response to change

## Core Scrum Framework

### The Scrum Team (No Sub-Teams)

**Product Owner (1 person)**
- Maximizes value of product
- Manages Product Backlog
- Makes prioritization decisions
- Accepts or rejects work

**Scrum Master (1 person)**
- Facilitates Scrum events
- Coaches team on Scrum
- Removes impediments
- Protects team from disruptions

**Developers (3-9 people)**
- Cross-functional skills
- Self-organizing
- Build product increment
- Accountable for quality

**Total Team Size:** 5-11 people (including PO and SM)

### The Scrum Events (Time-Boxed Rituals)

**Sprint (2-4 weeks)**
- Fixed-length iteration
- Working increment created
- No changes that endanger Sprint Goal

**Sprint Planning (Max 8 hours for 1-month Sprint)**
- What can be delivered this Sprint?
- How will chosen work get done?
- Create Sprint Backlog and Sprint Goal

**Daily Scrum (15 minutes)**
- Synchronize team
- Plan next 24 hours
- Inspect progress toward Sprint Goal

**Sprint Review (Max 4 hours for 1-month Sprint)**
- Inspect Sprint outcome
- Demonstrate working product
- Adapt Product Backlog based on feedback

**Sprint Retrospective (Max 3 hours for 1-month Sprint)**
- Inspect how last Sprint went
- Identify improvements
- Create plan for improvements

### The Scrum Artifacts (Transparency and Inspect/Adapt)

**Product Backlog**
- Ordered list of what's needed
- Single source of truth
- Product Owner manages
- Living document

**Sprint Backlog**
- Selected Product Backlog items for Sprint
- Plan for delivering them
- Developers own
- Updates daily

**Increment**
- Sum of completed Backlog items
- Meets Definition of Done
- Usable product

## Common Scrum Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: Sprint Zero / Hardening Sprint

**Problem:** "We need Sprint 0 to set up" or "Sprint 10 is hardening/testing"
**Why Bad:** Violates working increment every Sprint
**Fix:** Include setup and testing in Definition of Done from Sprint 1

### Anti-Pattern 2: Product Owner as Project Manager

**Problem:** PO assigning tasks, tracking hours, managing schedule
**Why Bad:** Team should be self-organizing
**Fix:** PO focuses on "what" and "why", team owns "how" and "when"

### Anti-Pattern 3: Stories Carrying Over Sprints

**Problem:** Stories started but not finished, moved to next Sprint
**Why Bad:** Reduces transparency, inflates velocity
**Fix:** Split stories smaller, improve estimation, or count as not done

### Anti-Pattern 4: Daily Scrum as Status Report

**Problem:** Everyone reports to Scrum Master or PO, no team interaction
**Why Bad:** Misses collaboration opportunities
**Fix:** Team members talk to each other, problem-solve together

### Anti-Pattern 5: Sprint Planning without Ready Backlog

**Problem:** Stories not refined, unclear, can't be estimated
**Why Bad:** Wastes Sprint Planning time, unclear commitment
**Fix:** Backlog refinement ongoing, "Ready" definition enforced

### Anti-Pattern 6: Skipping Retrospectives

**Problem:** "We're too busy" or "Nothing to improve"
**Why Bad:** Misses continuous improvement
**Fix:** Retrospectives non-negotiable, vary format to keep fresh
