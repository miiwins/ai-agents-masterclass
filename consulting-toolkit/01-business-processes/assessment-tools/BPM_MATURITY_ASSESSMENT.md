## Scoring and Interpretation

### Calculate Overall Maturity Score

**Formula:**
```
Weighted Score = (Part 1 × 0.20) + (Part 2 × 0.25) + (Part 3 × 0.25) + (Part 4 × 0.20) + (Part 5 × 0.10)
```

**Maturity Level:**
- **1.0 - 1.9:** Level 1 (Initial/Ad-Hoc)
- **2.0 - 2.9:** Level 2 (Managed/Repeatable)
- **3.0 - 3.9:** Level 3 (Defined/Standardized)
- **4.0 - 4.9:** Level 4 (Quantitatively Managed/Predictable)
- **5.0:** Level 5 (Optimizing/Innovative)

### Scoring Example

```
Part 1 - Documentation: (2 + 3 + 2) / 3 = 2.33
Part 2 - Governance: (2 + 3 + 2) / 3 = 2.33
Part 3 - Measurement: (3 + 2 + 1) / 3 = 2.00
Part 4 - Improvement: (2 + 3 + 2) / 3 = 2.33
Part 5 - Technology: (2 + 2) / 2 = 2.00

Weighted Score:
(2.33 × 0.20) + (2.33 × 0.25) + (2.00 × 0.25) + (2.33 × 0.20) + (2.00 × 0.10)
= 0.47 + 0.58 + 0.50 + 0.47 + 0.20
= 2.22

Result: Level 2 (Managed/Repeatable) - Lower range
```
