## Project Execution

### Q: How long should an assessment take?

**A:** Typical timelines:

- **Quick assessment:** 1-2 weeks (high-level, 5-10 interviews)
- **Standard assessment:** 2-4 weeks (detailed, 15-20 interviews)
- **Comprehensive assessment:** 4-8 weeks (enterprise-wide, 30+ interviews)

**Factors affecting timeline:**
- Organization size and complexity
- Stakeholder availability
- Scope of processes being assessed
- Existing documentation quality

---

### Q: How do I price my consulting services?

**A:** Common pricing models:

**Hourly/Daily Rate:**
- Typical range: $150-500/hour depending on expertise and market
- Use for small, well-defined projects
- Easy to explain and adjust

**Fixed Price Project:**
- Based on estimated hours × rate
- Add 20-30% buffer for unknowns
- Use when scope is very clear
- Risky if scope is uncertain

**Value-Based Pricing:**
- Price based on value delivered (e.g., 10% of cost savings)
- Highest potential returns
- Requires ability to quantify value
- Best for experienced consultants

**Retainer:**
- Monthly fee for ongoing support
- Provides predictable income
- Works well for long-term relationships

**Start conservatively**, then increase rates as you gain experience and results.

---

### Q: What if the client keeps changing requirements (scope creep)?

**A:** Implement these protections:

**Prevention:**
- Define scope clearly in SOW
- Get written approval on scope
- Set expectations about change process
- Include assumptions and exclusions

**During Project:**
- Document all requests
- Use change request template
- Explain impact on timeline/budget
- Get approval before proceeding

**Response Script:**
> "That's a great idea! Since it's outside our original scope, let me document it as a change request. It will add approximately [X days/dollars] to the project. Would you like me to prepare a formal estimate, or should we consider this for Phase 2?"

---

### Q: How do I handle difficult stakeholders?

**A:** Strategies by stakeholder type:

**The Blocker** (resists all change):
- Understand their concerns privately
- Find what they care about and address it
- Give them a role in the solution
- Get executive sponsor to reinforce importance

**The Ghost** (never available):
- Escalate to their manager or sponsor
- Make participation a stated requirement
- Offer flexible meeting times
- Document impact of their absence

**The Hijacker** (takes over meetings):
- Set clear agendas and stick to them
- Use parking lot for off-topic items
- Politely redirect: "Great point. Let's discuss that separately."
- Manage time strictly

**The Skeptic** (questions everything):
- Provide data and evidence
- Share relevant case studies
- Acknowledge valid concerns
- Turn them into a champion by addressing concerns

## Troubleshooting

### Q: What if I don't know the answer to a client question?

### Q: My project is behind schedule. What should I do?

**A:** Recovery actions:

**Immediate (Today):**
